Lectures on dynamic programming at Keio University

For the first lecture we will cover the file preliminaries.pdf.

In the second lecture we will cover the standard [optimal growth model](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/optgrowth.html).

The second lecture includes some programming.  This is optional.  If you want
to follow along you should read and work through the following lectures.
